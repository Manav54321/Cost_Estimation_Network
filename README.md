# Cost Estimation Network 
A laptop price predictor,  using Ensemble techniques
- I developed a machine learning model to predict laptop prices using various regression techniques, achieving an initial R2 score of 0.74. By employing stacking and voting ensemble methods, I improved the score to 0.88.
- I gathered a messy dataset of laptop prices from Kaggle, requiring extensive cleaning, EDA, and feature engineering using tools like ColumnTransformer, pipelines, and OneHotEncoding.
- After preparing the data, I built multiple regression models(like Linear, Ridge, Lasso, KNN Regressor, DTRegressor, SVM, RandomForest Resgressor, AdaBoostRegressor, GradientBoostRegressor, and XGBRegressor) and applied ensemble techniques. The final model was deployed on a Streamlit app.
